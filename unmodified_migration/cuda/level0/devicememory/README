Notes:
This benchmark was originally implemented in the SHOC Benchmark Suite (https://github.com/vetter/shoc). It is modified to support managed memory allocation.

The benchnmark measures device memory bandwidth, including global, constant, and local (shared) memory.

USAGE:
./devicememory [options]

    -d, --device                 specify device(s) to run on
    -h, --help                   print this usage
    -m, --metricsFile            path of file to write metrics to
    -n, --passes                 specify number of passes
    -p, --properties             show properties for available platforms and devices
    -q, --quiet                  enable concise output
        --uvm                    use managed memory via cudaMallocManaged instead of cudaMalloc. Not compatible with other --uvm* flags
    -v, --verbose                enable verbose output
